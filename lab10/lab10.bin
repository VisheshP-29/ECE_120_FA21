; The purpose and general function of this code program is to find the sum of all the positive
; numbers in a given file. The file, numbers.bin, contains the 10 16-bit binary words that the
; program will iterate through. The numbers are stored at a specific location in memory that 
; the program will have to access to get the numbers.
; Register Table:
; R1 - value stored at memory location of R3
; R3 - value of location in memory that contains the 16-bit binary word to check
; R4 - counter that counts down from 10
; R5 - total working sum of positive numbers in memory

0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here

1110 011 000110001    ; LEA R3, PCoffset	stores memory location of words in R3
0101 100 100 1 00000  ; AND R4, R4, #0		resets R4 to 0
0001 100 100 1 01010  ; ADD R4, R4, #10		adds 10 to R4
0101 101 101 1 00000  ; AND R5, R5, #0		resets R5 to 0
0110 001 011 000000   ; LDR R1, R3, #0		stores value of memory location of R3 in R1
0000 100 000000001    ; BRn #1			checks if R1 is negative and branches accordingly
0001 101 101 0 00 001 ; ADD R5, R5, R1		adds value in R1 to R5
0001 011 011 1 00001  ; ADD R3, R3, #1		increments R3
0001 100 100 1 11111  ;	ADD R4, R4, #-1		decrements R4
0000 001 111111010    ; BRp #-6			checks if R4 is positive and loops back, if not continues
1111 0000 00100101    ; TRAP			halts the program
